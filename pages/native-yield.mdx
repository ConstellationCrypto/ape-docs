# Native Yield on ApeChain

ApeChain offers native yield for certain bridged assets. Native yield represents a groundbreaking feature for the blockchain community, offering automatic yield on an asset to depositors on the ApeChain L3.

Initially, native yield on ApeChain will only be available for bridged $APE, but this feature will eventually extend to other assets such as $ETH and USD Stablecoins.
