# Native Yield on ApeChain

ApeChain offers native yield for certain bridged assets. Native yield represents a groundbreaking feature for the blockchain community, offering automatic yield on an asset to depositors on the ApeChain L3.

Initially, native yield on ApeChain will only be available for bridged $APE, but this feature will eventually extend to other assets such as $ETH and USD Stablecoins.

## Yield Modes

ApeChain supports three different yield modes: automatic, void, and delegate. The [ArbInfo contract](https://explorer.curtis.apechain.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000065?tab=write_contract) can be used to update the yield mode for an address. By default, all addresses start in automatic mode where yield is automatically earned each block. Whenever a contract is deployed, the yield mode is switched to void where yield is disabled to maximize compatibility with existing contracts. The contract can modify its yield mode by calling the [ArbInfo contract](https://explorer.curtis.apechain.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000065?tab=write_contract).

## Delegate Yield Mode

In delegate yield mode, the address has a fixed balance and yield is sent to a delegate address instead. Note that delegating yield does not chain and yield delegated to an address that is not in automatic yield mode is effectively lost.

## Balance Values

The following fields are added to the StateAccount object to track yield: flags, fixed, shares, debt, and delegate.

Balance is computed as follows:

balance = account.shares * global.sharePrice + account.fixed - account.debt

eth_getBalanceValues can be used to get all the balance values for an address:

cast rpc --rpc-url https://rpc.curtis.apechain.com eth_getBalanceValues 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 latest

eth_getSharePrice can be used to get the global share price:

cast rpc --rpc-url https://rpc.curtis.apechain.com eth_getSharePrice latest

## Yield Rate

The apy is currently set to 10%. The [ArbOwnerPublic contract](https://explorer.curtis.apechain.com/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b?tab=read_contract) may be used to get the share price and annual percentage yield.
