## What is Remix? 
Remix Project is a robust set of tools that can be used by individuals of any skill level throughout the entire process of developing contracts, and it also serves as an educational platform for learning and experimenting with Ethereum.

## Getting Started with Remix 
1. Visit Remix to get started. 
1. Under **Featured Plugins**, select **Solidity**.
3. Navigate to the **File Explorer** and click "**+**" to create a Smart Contract 
4. Input your smart contract or use the sample contract below.
```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greeting;

    // Constructor to set the initial greeting
    constructor() {
        greeting = "Hello, ApeChain!";
    }

    // Function to set a new greeting
    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    // Function to get the current greeting
    function getGreeting() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }
}
```
5. Navigate to the **Compile** sidebar option and click Compile.
